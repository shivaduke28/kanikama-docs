# Kanikama Manager

Describe the Kanikama settings for the scene.
Use `Packages/Kanikama/Prefabs/KanikamaManager.prefab`.

This component requires a Unity's Camera component to control the timing of lighting updates. Because its rendering result will not be used, set 1px RenderTexture to its RenderTarget.

The depth of the Camera need to be less than the depth of the Main Camera, and greater than that of Cameras used by `Kanikama Monitor Group` (may be `-1` in VRChat).
